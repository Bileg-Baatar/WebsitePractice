            Charles Xavier. His organization, formerly known as the X-men, was
            created with the purpose of educating and training people who possess
            supernatural abilities. While the X-Men was originally invite only, the
            Hero&#39s SuperUniversity is open to public admission. Possession of
            superhuman abilities is no longer a prerequisite for admission. This
            year, the Hero&#39s SuperUniversity will celebrate its 100th anniversary
            since its founding.</p></div>
